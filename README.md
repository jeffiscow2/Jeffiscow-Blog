# My Blog jeffiscow.xyz

I took a class that taught me a bit about HTML and CSS, So I decided to give it a shot making a blog from scratch.
I started planning the basic layout and content way before I took the class.

The goal of this project is to let the info stick to my brain, move away from WordPress and have place to post what im working on.



## Minimum Viable Product Progress

- [ ] 4 main page static website 

- [ ] Home page that will have basic info few recent blog post links to other pages 

- [ ] About me page will have picture of me or picture I took. Kinda resume thing 

- [ ] All blog post page

- [ ] Projects/portfolio  

## Rough Layout

Drew these up its the general vibe I'm going for but it will probably change as I go.
