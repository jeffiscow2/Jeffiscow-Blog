# My Blog jeffiscow.xyz

I took a class that taught me a bit about HTML and CSS, So I decided to give it a shot at making a blog from scratch.
I started planning the basic layout and content way before I took the class.

The goal of this project is to let the info stick to my brain, move away from WordPress, and have a place to post what I'm working on.



## Minimum Viable Product Progress

- [] 4 main page static website 

- [] Home page that will have basic info and a few recent blog post links to other pages 

- [] About me page will have a picture of me or a picture I took. Kinda resume thing 

- [] All blog post page

- [] Projects/Portfolio  

## Rough Layout

Drew these up. It's the general vibe I'm going for, but it will probably change as I go.
